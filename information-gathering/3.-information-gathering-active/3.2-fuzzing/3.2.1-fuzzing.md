# 3.2.1 Fuzzing

Fuzzing involves sending malformed data into application input and watching for unexpected crashes.

Fuzzing is like an art to me. It is not of everybody's taste. To me this is the most difficult part. It involves two things.

1. Software/Web app testing.
2. You should be aware of how technology works at assembly level.

You need experience in both software testing and pentesting to fuzz.

## Step 1\) Identifying various input points

* We need to list all the points of input.

## Step 2\) We try to send various malformed data.

* our main intention of sending this malformed data, is that the application breaks.
* like carefully designed input such that the application break.
* like sending special symbols
* like sending a large data as input
* like sending random values
