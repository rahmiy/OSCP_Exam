# 3.1.2.2 Nmap Port Scanning

1. **Accountability of the traffic** : What amount of traffic you are sending out to the network.
2. **Network Sweeping** : Self Explanatory.

* `nmap -sn 10.11.1.1-254`
  * `-sn` ping scan
* `nmap -v -sn 10.11.1.1-254 -oG ping-sweep.txt`
  * `-v` verbose 
  * `-sn` ping scan
  * `-oG` output file in a grepable format, so that we could use grep command easily on the output.
* `nmap -sT -A --top-ports=20 10.11.1.1-254 -oG top-port-sweep.txt`
  * `-sT` connect\(\) scan, complete 3 way handshake
  * `-A` enable all different features during scanning like OS detection, version detection, traceroute.
  * `-top-ports=20` nmap maintain a list of commonly use ports. Here it just uses the top 20 of these common ports.
  * `-oG` grepable output.

3. **OS Fingerprinting** : Operating systems often have slightly different implementations of the TCP/IP stack, such as default TTL values, and TCP window size. These slight differences create a fingerprint which can often be identified by Nmap.
