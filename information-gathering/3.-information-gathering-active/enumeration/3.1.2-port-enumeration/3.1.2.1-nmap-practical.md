# 3.1.2.1 Nmap Port Scanning

## Mistakes to avoid during port scanning

*  UDP port scanning is often unreliable, as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP packets. This can lead to false positives in your scan, and you will regularly see UDP port scans showing all UDP ports open on a scanned machine.
* Most port scanners do not scan all available ports, and usually have a preset list of “interesting ports” that are scanned.
* People often forget to scan for UDP services, and stick only to TCP scanning, thereby seeing only half of the equation.

## 1\) TCP CONNECT Scanning

complete 3 way handshake

## 2\) TCP Stealth / SYN Scanning

* Dont go with the name "Stealth", these port scan too could be detected by firewalls.
* sending SYN packets to various ports on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake.
* If a TCP port is open, a SYN-ACK should be sent back from the target machine, informing us that the port is open, without the need to send a final ACK back to the target machine.

## 3\) UDP Scanning

* As UDP is stateless, we may not know whether our requests are processed by the target machine or not.
* ICMP does the job of confirmation by sending a response if the port is not reachable means if the port is not open.
* But if the port is open we may not get any response.
