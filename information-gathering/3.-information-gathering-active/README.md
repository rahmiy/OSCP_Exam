# 1. Information Gathering \(Active\)

In active information gathering we generally find these 3 things.

1. Identifying systems.
2. Identifying services.
3. Identifying vulnerabilities.

To achieve these tasks I use

1. Enumeration
2. Fuzzing

Features to consider while deciding tools to use for active information gathering.

1. Efficiency and Effectiveness - Masscan, SPARTA
2. Features - Nmap
