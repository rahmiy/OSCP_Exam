# 8.0 Nmap Traffic Accountability

In many cases we may need to estimate the network traffic that we are sending in to the network during port scans. This statistics could be estimated using "iptables" tool.

We estimate the traffic for one node. To find the traffic in the complete network, we multiply the one node traffic with the number of nodes.

After the nmap scan is completed, use the below command to get the required statistics.

Say the network has 100 nodes, then the traffic sent to network during nmap is 100 x 71796 \(bytes\).
