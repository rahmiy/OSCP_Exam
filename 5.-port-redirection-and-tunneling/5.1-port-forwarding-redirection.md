# 5.1 Port forwarding/Redirection

* Port redirection is used in penetration testing, when the channel does not support a protocol, but we want to somehow use a particular protocol in a non supported network channel.
  * Suppose in my internal environment ftp traffic to outside is not supported.
  * But I want to somehow use it, to download a latest PC game.
  * What I could do to solve this problem, is to set up a relay server in between the client system \(inside company network\) and ftp server. The relay server is outside of the company network, with no such protocol restriction.
  * This relay will listen for non ftp protocol  which is allowed like HTTPS. The client system will send ftp traffic but not on port 21\(FTP\), but on port 443\(HTTPS\), to relay server.
  * The relay server will be configured a listner which listen for HTTPS traffic.
  * Given the relay server will then forward the received traffic to proper port i.e 21\(FTP\) to the ftp server.
  * It then sends the received response back to the client system inside the organization network.
* In kali linux we have a tool called **rinetd** for port forwarding/redirection.
* We use port forwarding to, first listen for a communication and then forwarding that communication to some other address + port combination.
